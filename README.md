# AI-Powered-Drone-Classification-System
This project is a final-year Bachelor’s Engineering project focused on classifying aerial objects—such as birds or drones—using spectrogram data derived from micro-Doppler radar signatures. The core objective is to train a deep learning model that can distinguish between different object classes based on their spectrograms.
